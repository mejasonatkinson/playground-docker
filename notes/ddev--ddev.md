### [Get Started with DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

DDEV is an open source tool for launching local PHP development environments in minutes.

These environments can be extended, version controlled, and shared, so you can take advantage of a Docker workflow without Docker experience or bespoke configuration. Projects can be changed, powered down, or removed just as easily as theyâ€™re started.

System Requirements

- MacOS
- Windows WSL2
- Traditional Windows
- Linux
- Gitpod and GitHub Codespaces

### [CMS Quickstarts](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/quickstart/)

- Craft CMS
- Drupal
- Laravel 
- Magento
- Moodle
- Shopware
- TYPO3
- WordPress
