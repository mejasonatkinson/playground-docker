Ths tutorial talks about:

- VUE, NUXT
- Docker
- GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
    - Cloud Run
- Firebase

To follow along requires a level of understand of all 4 of these systems/tools... which sadly I don't currently have.

For this reason, you will not find any more notes here until I feel more capable to do so.
