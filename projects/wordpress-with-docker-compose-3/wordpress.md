# Docker Compose

## Wordpress container using docker-compose

Run `docker-compose up -d` or by clicking the play button in docker desktop.

This project was made from a tutorial by [Andrew Schmelyun](https://www.youtube.com/@aschmelyun) called: [Build a solid WordPress dev environment with Docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIqWxjDj4IU).

### Why use docker-compose?

Simplest of answers: with docker you would need to create/destory a container each time you make a change, with docker-compose it doesn't...
